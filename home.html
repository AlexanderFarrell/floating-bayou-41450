			<p>The following web page will be used for the CS 313 class in learning how to host web applications.</p>
			<p>I took the class because I'd like to learn how to host things on a server and work with the web. I am an aspiring game developer, and I think its truly amazing what the web has done for video games over the past 20-30 years. From setting up a session over IPX to today where we have E-Sports, streaming, widespread accessibility to setting up a server for a game, cloud services, etc. </p>
			<p>I'm excited to see where things go in the future and to learn from this class</p>
